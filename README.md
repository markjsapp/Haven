## What is Haven?

Haven is a full-featured chat application servers, channels, DMs, friends, roles, voice, screen and file sharing with one fundamental difference: **all message content is encrypted client-side before it ever touches the server**. The backend is an intentional "dumb relay" for encrypted blobs. It handles routing, auth, and access control, and has zero knowledge of what you're saying or sending. Current beta build is hosted in EU/Germany.

### What the server can see
- Encrypted blobs (messages, metadata, attachments)
- Public cryptographic keys (for key exchange)
- Routing data (channel IDs, ephemeral sender tokens, timestamps)

### What the server cannot see
- Message content (Double Ratchet / Sender Keys encryption)
- Sender identity within channels (sealed sender tokens)
- Server/channel names (encrypted metadata)
- File contents or types (client-side encryption with padded sizes)
- Email addresses (hashed before storage)

## Why Use Haven?

Most chat platforms choose between features and privacy. Haven doesn't.

**Haven gives you Discord-level features with Signal-level privacy.** Your server, your data, your keys. The backend never sees plaintext not messages, not filenames, not even channel names. Features that are normally paywalled like animated emojis, higher quality video and voice calls, are uncompromised.

### How Haven compares to other open-source alternatives

| | Haven | [Stoat](https://stoat.chat/) (formerly Revolt) | [Spacebar](https://spacebar.chat/) (formerly Fosscord) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| End-to-end encryption | Yes (all messages) | Planned, not yet implemented | Not implemented |
| Backend language | Rust | Rust | TypeScript (Node.js) |
| Database | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | PostgreSQL |
| Discord API compatible | No (own API) | No (own API) | Yes (reimplements Discord's API) |
| Voice & video | Yes (LiveKit) | Yes (LiveKit), maturing | Partial (WebRTC WIP) |
| Self-hostable | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Mobile apps | Planned | Android, iOS | None |
| License | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0 |

**[Stoat](https://stoat.chat/)** is a polished, feature-rich Discord alternative with native mobile apps and a growing community. It does not yet offer end-to-end encryption, though it's on their roadmap. If you want a mature, general-purpose chat platform and don't need E2EE, Stoat is a solid choice.

**[Spacebar](https://spacebar.chat/)** takes a unique approach: it reimplements Discord's backend API, so existing Discord bots and client libraries work out of the box. It's still in active development and not yet production-ready. Like Stoat, it does not offer end-to-end encryption.

**Haven** is purpose-built for privacy. Every message is encrypted client-side before reaching the server — the backend is an intentional "dumb relay" for encrypted blobs. If E2EE is a requirement, Haven is the only option in this space that delivers it today.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.77+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### 1. Start infrastructure
```bash
docker compose up -d    # PostgreSQL + Redis
```

### 2. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Defaults work for local development
```

### 3. Run the backend
```bash
cargo run
# Server starts on http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. Run the frontend
```bash
cd packages/haven-core && npm install && npm run build
cd ../web && npm install && npm run dev
# Frontend starts on http://localhost:5173
```

### 5. Verify
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health   # → "ok"
```

The first user to register is automatically promoted to instance admin.

## Testing

```bash
# Rust backend
cargo test

# haven-core — 78 tests
cd packages/haven-core && npx vitest run

# Web frontend — 61 tests
cd packages/web && npx vitest run
```

Docker must be running for Rust integration tests (they need PostgreSQL + Redis).

## Deployment

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the full production deployment guide, covering:
- Hetzner Cloud VPS setup (Debian 12, ~8/mo)
- Docker Compose production stack (Caddy + Haven + PostgreSQL + Redis + LiveKit)
- Auto-TLS via Let's Encrypt
- Invite-only registration for beta
- Backup strategies

See [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md) for the development workflow and how to push updates.
